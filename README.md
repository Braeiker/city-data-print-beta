# City Data Print

This is a JavaScript application that allows you to get scores for various categories based on a specific city. It uses the Teleport API to retrieve data based on the city name provided by the user.

## How It Works

The application has a simple user interface composed of the following elements:

- An input field to enter the city name.
- A search button to initiate the search for scores.
- A reset button to clear the input and reset the view.
- A result container to display the search results.
- A title element that appears only at the beginning.

## Instructions

1. Enter the desired city name into the input field.
2. Click the search button to get the scores for various categories related to the entered city.
3. The scores will be displayed in the result container. The categories are followed by their respective scores, with a maximum score of 10 for each category.
4. If the city name is invalid or not available, an appropriate error message will be displayed.

## Requirements

- This application uses the Teleport API to retrieve scores for city categories. Make sure you have an active internet connection for the application to function properly.
- The application is based on JavaScript and requires no additional installations as it runs directly in your browser.
